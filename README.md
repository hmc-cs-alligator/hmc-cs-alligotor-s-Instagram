For this assignment I created a mock instagram-like website by following along with "Make an instagram-like site in under 30 minutes!" by the channel Beginner Programmers, using Ruby on Rails and several of the programs it supports. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE)

I had a lot of trouble getting this going on PC, though checking the tips would've helped me a lot when I got stuck later on. Below are some pictures of the work that I did.
